Headscale/Tailscale Introduction:
- https://github.com/juanfont/headscale#readme

Headscale official documentation:
- https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/tree/main/docs

This submodule is based on the instruction in
- https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/docs/running-headscale-container.md

-------------------

Usage

Modify the config template to suit your need, but notice that customer ip-prefix may not take effect if the tailscale client does not support it. Please read the comments in the config.yaml file for more details.

Submodule setup
1. Clone the main docker service system
	- git clone https://github.com/lhb-cafe/docker-service
2. Modify global_env file with your top-level domain
3. Init and pull the submodules
	- git submodule init
	- git submodule update
4. Start services
	- [path_to_docker_service_sh] start nginx-proxy-manager headscale
5. Configure nginx-proxy-manager to reverse proxy for headscale
	- Follow nginx-proxy-manger document at https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager/blob/develop/README.md
	- It's highly recommended to use SSL to protect the clients
	- Add http proxy.
		- The dest URL for headscale is http://headscale:8080, and headscale-ui is http://headscale-ui
		- headscale needs to be proxied on {YOUR_HOST}/, and headscale-ui on {YOUR_HOST}/web, with the same hostname (including subdomain)
6. Enjoy

Notes:

Use headscale.sh as the traditional `headsacale` tool, e.g.,
	headscale.sh users create MYUSER

headscale-ui can be safely exposed to public network (AFAIK). See headscale-ui site for details:
	https://github.com/gurucomputing/headscale-ui/blob/master/SECURITY.md
That said, the nginx-proxy-manager webUI is not safe and you should not expose it in production.
