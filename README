Headscale/Tailscale Introduction:
- https://github.com/juanfont/headscale#readme

Headscale official documentation:
- https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/tree/main/docs

This submodule is based on the instruction in
- https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/docs/running-headscale-container.md

-------------------

Usage

Before running this service, modify the config.yaml to use your correct server url. Modify the config to your own fit, but notice that customer ip-prefix may not take effect if the tailscale client does not support it. Please read the comments in the config.yaml file for more details.

Submodule setup
1. Clone the main docker service system
	- git clone https://github.com/lhb-cafe/docker-service
2. Init and pull the submodules
	- git submodule init
	- git submodule update

Headscale server setup:
1. Set your actual server url in config.yaml
2. Start the service:
	run as a submodule of docker-service:
		- docker_service.sh headscale restart
	or, run directly as a standalone service:
		- DOCKER_SERVICE=headscale docker-compose up -d
3. Use the headscale.sh script similar to the headscale tool. It proxies the command to headscale inside the contianer through `docker exec`. e.g.,
	- headscale.sh -h
	- headscale.sh users create MYUSER
4. Follow the instruction in https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/docs/running-headscale-container.md to connect from clients
