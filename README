Usage

Modify the config template to suit your need, but notice that customer ip-prefix may not take effect if the tailscale client does not support it. Please read the comments in the config.yaml file for more details.

Submodule setup
1. Clone the main docker service system
	- git clone https://github.com/lhb-cafe/docker-service

Notes:

Use headscale.sh as the traditional `headsacale` tool, e.g.,
	headscale.sh users create MYUSER

headscale-ui can be safely exposed to public network (AFAIK). See headscale-ui site for details:
